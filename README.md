# Real estate based API project

### Technologies:

Rename the .example.env file, inside set the variables


Note: This idea comes from Juan De La torre's course: Node.js - Bootcamp Desarrollo Web inc. MVC y REST APIs, there he uses a Pug template engine and is written in Javascript, plus he uses too a local mysql database . The current project is just the API with no front-end and  it is also rewritten in typescript, its database is built with docker.
